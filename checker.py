*** Do not start this project until you have fully completed Exercise 3. ***

In this project you need to perform semantic checks on your program.
This problem is multifaceted and complicated.  To make it somewhat
less brain exploding, you need to take it slow and in parts.

First, you will need to define a symbol table that keeps track of
previously declared identifiers.  The symbol table will be consulted
whenever the compiler needs to lookup information about variable and
constant declarations.  

Next, you will need to define objects that represent the different
builtin datatypes and record information about their capabilities.
See the file gone/typesys.py.

Finally, you'll need to write code that walks the AST and enforces
a set of semantic rules. Here is a list of the minimal set of things
that need to be checked:

1.  Names and symbols:

    All identifiers must be defined before they are used.  This
    includes variables, constants, and typenames.  For example, this
    kind of code generates an error:

       a = 3;              // Error. 'a' not defined.
       var a int;

    Note: typenames such as "int", "float", and "string" are built-in
    names that should already be defined at the start of checking.

2.  Types of literals and constants

    All literal symbols are implicitly typed and must be assigned a
    type of "int", "float", or "string".  This type is used to set
    the type of constants.  For example:

       const a = 42;         // Type "int"
       const b = 4.2;        // Type "float"
       const c = "forty";    // Type "string"


3.  Binary operator type checking

    Binary operators only operate on operands of the same type and produce a
    result of the same type.  Otherwise, you get a type error.  For example:

        var a int = 2;
        var b float = 3.14;

        var c int = a + 3;    // OK
        var d int = a + b;    // Error.  int + float
        var e int = b + 4.5;  // Error.  int = float

4.  Unary operator type checking.

    Unary operators always return a result that's the same type as the operand.

5.  Supported operators

    Here are the operators that need to be supported by each type:

    int:      binary { +, -, *, /}, unary { +, -}
    float:    binary { +, -, *, /}, unary { +, -}
    string:   binary { + }, unary { }

    Attempts to use unsupported operators should result in an error. 
    For example:

        var string a = "Hello" + "World";     // OK
        var string b = "Hello" * "World";     // Error (unsupported op *)

    Bonus: Support mixed-type operators in certain cases

        var string a = "Hello" * 4;          // OK. String replication
        var string b = 4 * "Hello";          // OK. String replication

6.  Assignment.

    The left and right hand sides of an assignment operation must be
    declared as the same type.

        var a int;
        a = 4 + 5;     // OK
        a = 4.5;       // Error. int = float

    Values can only be assigned to variable declarations, not
    to constants.

        var a int;
        const b = 42;

        a = 37;        // OK
        b = 37;        // Error. b is const

Implementation Strategy:
------------------------
You're going to use the NodeVisitor class defined in gone/ast.py to
walk the parse tree.   You will be defining various methods for
different AST node types.  For example, if you have a node BinaryOp,
you'll write a method like this:

      def visit_BinaryOp(self, node):
          ...

To start, make each method simply print out a message:

      def visit_BinaryOp(self, node):
          print('visit_BinaryOp:', node)
          ...

This will at least tell you that the method is firing.  Try some
simple code examples and make sure that all of your methods
are actually running when you walk the parse tree.

After you're satisfied that your methods are running, add support
for a symbol name and focus on the problem of managing names. 
Declarations such as:

      var a int;
      const b = 42;

put names into the symbol table.  The symbol table could be as
simple as a dict:
     
      { 'a': ...,  'b': .... }

Use of a name elsewhere such as in an expression "37 + b" look things
up in the symbol table. Write some test inputs that involve undefined
names and make sure it's working.   Note:  There is some extra complexity
in your symbol table in that you also need to check more than just types.
For example, if "b" is a constant, you can't assign to it.  You'll
need to have some way to check for that.

After names are working, move on to type propagation. Start with
literals.  Work your way through more complex operations such
as binary operators and unary operators.  You're going to be
checking and propagating types.  For example, your visit_BinaryOp() 
method might look roughly like this:

     def visit_BinaryOp(self, node):
         self.visit(node.left)
         self.visit(node.right)
         if node.left.type != node.right.type:
             # Type Error!
         else:
            node.type = node.left.type    # Propagate the type

After you're propagating types, shift your focus to the capabilities
of each type. For example, the '-' operator works with int and float
types, but not with strings.   You'll need to figure out some
way to check for this.

Wrap up by focusing on variable assignment and other details.
Make sure that the left and right sides have the same type.

General thoughts and tips
-------------------------
The main thing you need to be thinking about with checking is program
correctness.  Does this statement or operation that you're looking at
in the parse tree make sense?  If not, some kind of error needs to be
generated.  Use your own experiences as a programmer as a guide (think
about what would cause an error in your favorite programming
language).

One challenge is going to be the management of many fiddly details. 
You've got to track symbols, types, and different sorts of capabilities.
It's not always clear how to best organize all of that.  So, expect to
fumble around a bit at first.
